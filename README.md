  You are blowing me up with much sensitivity. You must be quite adept at guessing what's on one's mind! Why don't you try playing the Number Guessing App? ðŸ˜Ž
</p>

<p>
  The game is quite simple: the computer is thinking a number between 1 and 100, and you are to guess which number it is. You are given a certain number of attempts depending on which difficulty level you choose.
</p>

<p>
  Number Guessing App is written in Python and you can launch it either from any local IDE which is able to compile Python source code, or      any other Python code editors/compilers from the web which enables you to edit and run the code.
